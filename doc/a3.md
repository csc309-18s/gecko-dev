Diagnosis of bug:
The bug is that in the extensions.inc.css file uses hard coded colours for the mozilla add-on manager. Rather than using the hard coded colours in extensions.inc.css, the variable in common.inc.css should be used instead.

The fix of this bug will save a mozilla contributor time when changing styles for mozilla. For instance if the colours for mozilla was changed using common.inc.css, the add-on manager will retain the same colours due to hard coded colours in extensions.inc.css.

There are few risks if any, due to fixing this bug. If a variable in common.inc.css was changed so that a background colour in the add-on manager matched the text that was over it. The text would be invisible.

Solution proposal:
Find hard coded colours in extensions.inc.css that match or are very similar a variable in common.inc.css. Also, colour variables in common.inc.css are associated with text, backgrounds, borders, etc. So, the context of the hard coded colour to be replaced should match the common.inc.css variable.

Testing:
Before adjusting the variables in extensions.inc.css screenshots of items in the mozilla add-on manager that may have their colour changes should be taken. After changing the colours of extensions.inc.css, the screenshots should be compared to the result.
